 # XDP Weighted Least-Connections Load Balancer

High-performance L4 load balancer implemented in XDP/eBPF
supporting stateful least-connections scheduling with in-datapath
connection tracking.

A NAT-based TCP load balancer implemented in eBPF at the XDP layer. Supports two scheduling algorithms — **Least Connections (LC)** and **Weighted Least Connections (WLC)** — each available in two connection-tracking modes. Backends are manageable at runtime via an interactive CLI. The load balancer filters traffic based on a configurable set of service VIP–port pairs, allowing multiple services to be handled simultaneously while ensuring unrelated network traffic passes through unaffected.

> **Why XDP?** Packets are processed before entering the Linux networking stack — minimal CPU overhead, maximum throughput.

## Overview

Each incoming TCP connection is assigned to a backend according to the active scheduling algorithm. The XDP eBPF program tracks connection state by inspecting TCP flags and maintaining lightweight per-connection structures in eBPF maps. Because everything runs at the XDP layer, packets are intercepted on arrival — before the kernel's normal network stack — keeping overhead very low.

## Why Least-Connections instead of Hash-Based Load Balancing

High-performance L4 load balancers in fast datapaths (including most XDP-based designs) commonly rely on **stateless flow hashing** (e.g., 5-tuple hashing) for backend selection.  
Hashing offers constant-time scheduling decisions and minimal per-packet overhead, making it attractive for high-throughput environments.

However, this approach has important practical limitations.

- Hashing assumes that traffic load is **evenly distributed across connections**, which is often not true in real deployments.
- Long-lived or high-throughput persistent connections (such as WebSockets, database sessions, or streaming RPC workloads) can create **significant load imbalance**, even when flow counts appear uniform.
- Stateless hashing cannot adapt to runtime backend load conditions because flow-to-backend mapping is deterministic for the lifetime of the connection.

A further challenge arises when **backend capacity changes dynamically**.

- Adjusting backend weights in a hashing-based scheduler typically requires **rehashing or remapping flows**, which can lead to:
  - sudden traffic shifts
  - connection churn
  - cache and state disruption on backends
- Incremental or fine-grained runtime weight updates are therefore difficult to apply without affecting existing traffic distribution.

This project explores **stateful least-connections scheduling implemented directly in the XDP datapath**, enabling adaptive backend selection based on live connection counts and configurable backend weights.

By maintaining lightweight per-connection state in eBPF maps, the load balancer:

- reacts to real-time load imbalance instead of relying on static flow distribution  
- supports dynamic backend addition, removal, and weight updates without rehashing existing connections  
- performs scheduling entirely in the fast path without requiring backend-side load reporting  

This design trades modest state-management overhead for **improved utilisation fairness, smoother weight transitions, and better handling of persistent or skewed workloads**, while still benefiting from the high throughput of XDP-based packet processing.

## Scheduling Algorithms

| Algorithm | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Least Connections (LC)** | Assigns each new connection to the backend with the fewest active connections. All backends are treated equally. |
| **Weighted Least Connections (WLC)** | Assigns connections based on `active_connections / weight`. Backends with higher weights receive a proportionally larger share of traffic. |

---

## Connection Tracking Modes

Both algorithms are available in two builds, differing only in *when* a connection is counted:

| Mode | Counts on | Pros | Cons |
|------|-----------|------|------|
| **SYN** | SYN packet arrival | Reserves backend immediately; more even distribution during bursts | Incomplete handshakes are briefly counted until cleaned up |
| **Established** | First non-SYN packet (after handshake completes) | Counters reflect only fully established connections | Under burst load, multiple SYNs may see stale counters before they update |

## Prerequisites

Install LLVM and required toolchain dependencies:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/llvm.sh
```

> **Requirements:** Root privileges, a modern Linux kernel with eBPF and XDP support.

---

## Configuration

The load balancer is configured using a **virtual service endpoint (VIP + port)** and a pool of backend servers.
### LC — `configs/backends_lc.json`

```json
{
  "service": {
    "vip": "10.45.179.173",
    "port": 8000
  },
  "backends": [
    {
      "ip": "10.45.179.166",
      "port": 8000
    },
    {
      "ip": "10.45.179.99",
      "port": 8000
    }
  ]
}
```

### WLC — `configs/backends_wlc.json`

```json
{
  "service": {
    "vip": "10.45.179.173",
    "port": 8000
  },
  "backends": [
    {
      "ip": "10.45.179.166",
      "port": 8000,
      "weight": 80
    },
    {
      "ip": "10.45.179.99",
      "port": 8000,
      "weight": 20
    }
  ]
}
```

Backends can also be added, removed, or reweighted live via the CLI after startup.

## Building

Build all four binaries at once:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This produces:

| Binary | Algorithm | Tracking mode |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| `lb_lc_syn` | Least Connections | SYN |
| `lb_lc_est` | Least Connections | Established |
| `lb_wlc_syn` | Weighted Least Connections | SYN |
| `lb_wlc_est` | Weighted Least Connections | Established |

---

## Running

**LC binaries:**

```bash
sudo ./lb_lc_syn -i <network-interface> -config configs/backends_lc.json
sudo ./lb_lc_est -i <network-interface> -config configs/backends_lc.json
```

**WLC binaries:**

```bash
sudo ./lb_wlc_syn -i <network-interface> -config configs/backends_wlc.json
sudo ./lb_wlc_est -i <network-interface> -config configs/backends_wlc.json
```

Replace `<network-interface>` with the interface to attach the XDP program to (e.g. `eth0`).

---

## Runtime CLI

After starting, an interactive prompt becomes available:

```
lb>
```

### LC commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `add <ip>` | Add a backend server |
| `del <ip>` | Remove a backend server |
| `list` | List backends and their current connection counts |

### WLC commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `add <ip> <weight>` | Add a backend server with a given weight |
| `del <ip>` | Remove a backend server |
| `update <ip> <weight>` | Update the weight of an existing backend |
| `list` | List backends with their weights and connection counts |

**Example session (WLC):**

```
lb> add 10.0.0.4 2
lb> update 10.0.0.2 3
lb> del 10.0.0.3
lb> list
```

---

### Verifying the XDP program is attached

```bash
sudo bpftool prog show
```

---

## Testing
To test the connection tracking the connections should persist for some time, you can either try large downloads which take time, or use the socat tool which keeps connections alive without sending alot of data

### 1. Start backend servers

Run this on each backend machine:

```bash
socat TCP-LISTEN:8000,reuseaddr,fork EXEC:/bin/cat
```

### 2. Send a single request

From a client machine:

```bash
socat - TCP:<load_balancer_ip>:8000
```

### 3. Simulate high concurrency

Launch 100 parallel requests simultaneously:

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 100); do
socat - TCP:<load_balancer_ip>:8000 &
done
```

### 4. Check active kernel TCP connections

```bash
ss -tan '( sport = :8000 )' | wc -l
```

### 5. Observe backend distribution

```
lb> list
```

Under burst load, the **SYN** variants distribute more evenly than the **established** variants because counters are incremented immediately on SYN arrival. With WLC, backends with higher weights should absorb a proportionally larger share of connections.

---

## Customization

The load balancer currently filters on **TCP port 8000**. To change this, edit the port filter in the eBPF programs:

```
bpf/lb_lc_syn.c
bpf/lb_lc_est.c
bpf/lb_wlc_syn.c
bpf/lb_wlc_est.c
```
